Overview
--------
If you're running in AWS, odds are you're using S3. Cumulus makes configuring your buckets much simpler through its easy-to-use JSON configuration. You can also share CORS and policy configuration between buckets. Read the following sections to learn about configuring your S3 environment with Cumulus. Example configuration can be found in the [Cumulus repo](https://github.com/lucidsoftware/cumulus).

Bucket Definition
-----------------

Each S3 bucket is defined in its own file, and the folder distributions are located in is [configurable](#configuration). File names for S3 bucket configuration correspond to the name of that bucket and are also the name that Cumulus will use to refer to your bucket in its output, and as input into its command line interface (minus the `.json`, of course). This section describes the base Bucket configuration, and the following sections describe how to configure the various features available to S3 Buckets. Buckets are JSON objects with the following attributes:

* `region` - the region the bucket should be located in
* `permissions` - A JSON object containing permission configuration. Can have any of the following attributes:
  * `cors` - a JSON object configuring the cors template. See [CORS Templates](#cors-templates) to learn how to create these templates. Has the following properties:
    * `template` - the name of the template to include
    * `vars` - a JSON object of variables to use in the template
  * `policy` - a JSON object configuring the policy template. See [Policy Templates](#policy-templates) to lear how to create templates.  Has the following properties:
    * `template` - the name of the template to include
    * `vars` - a JSON object of variables to use in the template
  * `grants` - A JSON object that configures users that have access to the bucket. See [Grants](#grants)
* `website` - Configuration to serve a static website out of this bucket. See [Static Website Configuration](#static-website-configuration) for more info.
* `logging` - Configuration to log access to this bucket. See [Bucket Logging](#bucket-logging) for more info.
* `notifications` - Configuration to provide notifications on bucket events. See [Bucket Notifications](#bucket-notifications) for more info.
* `lifecycle` - Configuration for lifecycle rules. See [Lifecycle Configuration](#lifecycle-configuration) for more info.
* `versioning` - a true/false value indicating if versioning is enabled on items in the bucket
* `replication` - Configuration for S3 Cross Region Replication. See [Bucket Replication](#bucket-replication) for more info.
* `tags` - an optional JSON object that specifies the tags to include on the bucket.  Each tag is in the form of `"key": "value"`

### CORS Templates

CORS controls which origins have access to the content in your bucket. A CORS template has the following properties:

* `origins` - an array of origins that are allowed to access content on the bucket e.g. `["www.example.com"]`
* `methods` - an array of methods that the origins are allowed to execute e.g. `["GET", "HEAD"]`
* `headers` - an array of headers that are allowed in a pre-flight `OPTIONS` request
* `exposed-headers` - an array headers that a client will be able to access from their application e.g. `["Origin"]`
* `max-age-seconds` - the number of seconds that a browser is allowed to cache a preflight response from the specified origins

Here is an example CORS configuration:

{% highlight json %}
[
  {
    "headers": [
      "Authorization"
    ],
    "methods": [
      "GET"
    ],
    "origins": [
      "*"
    ],
    "exposed-headers": [],
    "max-age-seconds": 86400
  }
]
{% endhighlight %}

### Policy Templates

Policies control access to the S3 bucket and its resources. Cumulus mirrors the format used by AWS for configuring policies. A detailed explanation of bucket policies by AWS can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html).

Here is an example policy configuration which allows public access to objects in whatever bucket you passed in as the value of the `bucket` variable:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "Version":"201=5-08-28",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Sid":"PublicGets",
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
    }
    "Resource":[{% raw %}"arn:aws:s3:::{{bucket}}/*"{% endraw %}]
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Grants

Grants control which accounts have permissions to perform actions on your bucket. A grants configuration has the following properties:

* `name` - the name of the account
* `email` - the email address of the account. Not required if `id` is defined
* `id` - the canonical AWS id of the account. Not required if `email` is defined
* `permissions` - an array of which permissions are given to the account. Valid values include `"all"`, `"list"`, `"update"`, `"view-permissions"`, and `"edit-permissions"`

Additionally, the following names match the ones in the AWS console, and, when used, do not need to be specified with an email or an id:

* AuthenticatedUsers
* Everyone
* LogDelivery

Here is an example grant:

{% highlight json %}
[
  {
  "name": "your-account",
    "id": "328ead623599bb1a2fc207d606cec78f54d201ed6e19db5f056a406bac48b77c",
    "permissions": ["list"]
  },
  {
    "name": "loggly",
    "email": "aws@loggly.com",
    "permissions": ["list", "update"]
  },
  {
    "name": "AuthenticatedUsers",
    "permissions": ["view-permissions"]
  },
  ...
]
{% endhighlight %}

### Static Website Configuration

S3 allows you to serve a static website from your bucket. To do so, add a JSON object called `"website"` to your bucket with the following attributes:

* `redirect` - the protocol and hostname to redirect all traffic to when a request is received to an object in the bucket e.g. `"https://www.example.com"`. Should not be defined if `index` is defined
* `index` - the object to serve when requesting the index on the bucket. Should not be defined if `redirect` is defined
* `error` - the object to serve when a 4XX error occurs. Should only be defined if `redirect` is not defined.

Here are two website configuration examples (the first configures the bucket as a website, the second just redirects all traffic to the bucket):

{% highlight json %}
{
  "website": {
    "index": "index.html",
    "error": "error-pages/error.html"
  }
}

{
  "website": {
    "redirect": "https://myawesomesite.com"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Bucket Logging
S3 allows you to log access information about your bucket. To enable logging, provide a JSON object named `"logging"` to your bucket configuration with the following attributes:

* `target-bucket` - the name of the bucket in which to store logs
* `prefix` - the prefix to give to all generated log files

Here's an example:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "target-bucket": "logging-bucket",
  "prefix": "logs/"
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Bucket Notifications
When certain events happen in a bucket, S3 allows you to post an event to an SNS topic, SQS queue, or Lambda function. To do so, add an array named `"notifications"` to your bucket configuration, and fill it with JSON objects containing the following attributes:

* `name` - the name of the notification (something human readable)
* `triggers` - a string array containing the names of the events to notify on (for example `["ObjectCreated:*", "ObjectRemoved:Delete"]`)
* `prefix` - the prefix that objects must have in order to generate events
* `suffix` - the suffix that objects must have in order to generate events
* `type` - the type of notification to generate (accepts `"sns"`, `"sqs"`, and `"lambda"`)
* `target` - the name of the target asset

Here's an example of a notification configuration object:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "example-notification",
  "triggers": [
    "ObjectCreated:*"
  ],
  "prefix": "a",
  "suffix": "z",
  "type": "sns",
  "target": "example-topic"
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Lifecycle Configuration
S3 lets you configure lifecycle rules for the objects in a bucket. To configure lifecycle rules, add an array named `"lifecycle"` that contains JSON objects with the following attributes:

* `name` - the name of the rule (something human readable)
* `prefix` - the prefix for objects to apply the rule to
* `days-until-glacier` - the number of days before objects are transitioned to Glacier storage
* `days-until-delete` - the number of days before objects are deleted
* `past-versions` - for versioned buckets, an optional JSON object can be supplied to provide rules for objects for past versions of the bucket
  * `days-until-glacier` - the number of days before objects are transitioned to Glacier storage
  * `days-until-delete` - the number of days before objects are deleted

Here's an example lifecycle rule:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "lifecycle-rule",
  "prefix": "logs",
  "days-until-glacier": 10,
  "days-until-delete": 100,
  "past-versions": {
    "days-until-glacier": 5,
    "days-until-delete": 120
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Bucket Replication
To enable replication of a bucket to another bucket in another region, supply a JSON object named `"replication"` to your bucket configuration and give it the following attributes:

* `iam-role` - the name of the IAM role to use for replicating the bucket
* `prefixes` - an array of prefixes of the objects that replication applies to e.g. `["images/", "js/"]`. Omit to replicate the entire bucket
* `destination` - the name of the destination bucket for replicated items

Here's an example replication rule:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "iam-role": "a-role",
  "prefixes": [
    "a",
    "z"
  ],
  "destination": "backup-bucket"
}
{% endhighlight %}

### A Full Example

    "prefixes": [
      "a",
      "z"
    ],
    "destination": "backup-bucket"
  },
  "tags": {
    "a key": "a value"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Additional Information

There are some configuration options for S3 buckets that Cumulus does not handle because we do not use them at Lucid or do not want them managed by Cumulus at this time. These include:

* Advanced redirection rules for static website hosting
* Requester Pays

If you would like any of these limitations changed, please submit a pull request.

Diffing and Syncing S3
------------------------------

Cumulus's S3 module has the following usage:

{% highlight bash %}
cumulus s3 [diff|help|list|migrate|sync] <asset>
{% endhighlight %}

S3 buckets can be diffed, listed, and synced (migration is covered in the [following section](#migration)). The three actions do the following:

* `diff` - Shows the differences between the local definition and the AWS S3 configuration. If `<asset>` is specified, Cumulus will diff only the bucket defined in that file.
* `list` - Lists the names of the files that contain bucket definitions
* `sync` - Syncs local configuration with AWS. If `<asset>` is specified, Cumulus will sync only the bucket defined in the file with that name.

Migration
---------

If your environment is anything like ours, you have dozens of S3 buckets, and would rather not write Cumulus configuration for them by hand. Luckily, Cumulus provides a `migrate` task that will pull down your buckets and produce configuration for them. It will also pull down your CORS rules and bucket policies, and, where buckets are using the same CORS rules or policies, reference the same file.

Configuration
-------------
Cumulus reads configuration from a configuration file, `conf/configuration.json` (the location of this file can also be specified by running cumulus with the `--config` option). The values in `configuration.json` can be changed to customized to change some of Cumulus's behavior. The following is a list of the values in `configuration.json` that pertain to the S3 module:

* `$.s3.buckets.directory` - the directory where Cumulus expects to find S3 bucket definitions.
* `$.s3.buckets.cors.directory` - the directory where Cumulus expects to find CORS definitions.
* `$.s3.buckets.policies.directory` - the directory where Cumulus expects to find policy definitions.
* `$.s3.print-progress` - whether to print progress of the diff or sync operation as the operation moves onto a new bucket. This is helpful because diffing buckets can take a while, and if this configuration value is set to false, there is no feedback as to what is actually happening in Cumulus.
